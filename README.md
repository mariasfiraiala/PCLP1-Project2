## Task 1

- The first step is to allocate space (dynamically) for a matrix ( =allocate_data )
- Then we insert the new matrix, after reading its elements into an array of matrices
- The said array should be reallocated before each step, in order to make space for the new element
- We should also create an array of structures meant to store each matrices' dimension (number of rows and number of columns)

- One important thing to note is that the function returns the address of the 3d-array in order for it to properly be reallocated; same thing goes for the array of structs, modified by accesing their address.

- In main:
    - We declare some useful variables: one for every command we should react to, one for the collection of matrices (triple pointer), one that counts how many matrices we store, and finally the array of structures
    - We initialize the 2 arrays with space for only one element

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Task2

- The main type of data used for this task is the array of structures mentioned before: in the sense that the dimensions of each matrix are contained in it
- The index is read, and processed accordingly:
    - either printing the error message, when the matrix doesn't exist
    - or the said number of lines and columns
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 3

- Printing the matrix with a given index implies two things:
    - first checking whether the index is valid (more exactly if the matrix actually exists)
    - reading the matrix, however, using the 3d-array, because the matrix isn't stored elsewhere
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 4

- Reading the input first: the index, the number of lines, their indexes, the number of columns and their indexes, all refering to the new matrix
- We store the number of rows and the number of columns in two arrays, dynamically allocated
- Create the new matrix afterwards:
    - for every line index, we associate every column index, moving into the new matrix the value stored in the old one at the said indexes
    - after this, the old matrix must be freed
- The next step is to insert the croped matrix back into our collection and update its dimensions
- Lastly but not least, the arrays used for storing the lines and columns for the cropped matrix must be freed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 5

- After considering the error inducing cases, we move on to the multiplication algorithm:
    - 1st step: allocating memory for a the result of  the multiplication
    - 2nd step: implementing the multiplication, at the beginning setting the result to 0
    - 3rd step: reallocating memory for the new matrix (on the array of matrices as well as on the array of dimensions)
    - 4th step: inserting the matrix at the back of our collection
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 6

- For this task we used multiple helper functions: one that calculates the sum of each matrix, one that swaps elements during sorting and one that does the sorting 
- We allocate space for the said array of sums
- We calculate the sum for each matrix % MOD, to avoid overflow
- Lastly, the pointer to the first element of the array is returned
- The sorting algorithm is a simple bubble sort applied to the sum array:
    - we shouldn't forget when swapping to work on the other arrays too, the triple pointer and the dimension struct
- Fianlly we free the array of sums
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 7

- The main goal of this task is to create yet another new matrix in which the transpose will be constructed
- Obviously, the transpose will also be allocated dynamically
- The transposing algorithm is based on the mathematical observation that however we'll choose `t[i][j]`, an element of the transpose, its corespondent from the original (let it be a) is `a[j][i]`
- Getting rid of the old matrix is a must, so we'll free it
- The transpose takes its place in the array of the matrices
- The dimensions are updated, by swapping the number of rows with the number of columns
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 8

- Freeing data for a single matrix is handled by quite literally freeing the space it uses
- We'll subsequently copy all the matrices after this particular one, one index to the left, in order to not leave unused gaps in our array
- At the same time, we'll apply the same modifications to the array of structures
- Reallocating memory is only necessary when we have more than one element left in our arrays, justified by the fact that allocating space for an array of 0 elements doesn't make sense
- Returning the array of matrices, so the modifications are visible in main
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 9

- The last function gets rid of all the allocated space and helps keeping an optimal usage of resources
- Deallocating the matrices first
- Deallocating the array by itself
- We don't forget about the array of structures
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 10

- This implementation is based on the mathematical observation that we can partition every matrix into 4 differrent blocks and perform on them the multiplication algorithm based on a divide and conquer approach
- However, to avoid still making 8 multiplications for every step, the aforementioned partitions are used to implement only 7 multiplications, as it goes:
    - Let a11, a12, a21, a22 be the blocks derived from the first matrix
    - And b11, b12, b21, b22 the blocks derived from the second matrix
    - Using them we define 7 new matrices which are going to provide the final result of the multiplication
    - p1 = (a11 + a22)*(b11 + b22)

      p2 = (a21 + a22)*b11

      p3 = a11*(b12 - b22)

      p4 = a22*(b21 - b11)

      p5 = (a11 + a12)*b22

      p6 = (a21 - a11)*(b11 + b12)

      p7 = (a12 - a22)*(b21 + b22)
    - Let c be the result:

      c11 = p1 + p4 - p5 + p7

      c12 = p3 + p5

      c21 = p2 + p4
      
      c22 = p1 - p2 + p3 + p6
    - Because of their definition, an eight multiplication isn't necessary, thus optimizing the time complexity
    - We reiterate the same partitions until the matrices are made of only one element
    - At the same time we calculate the result, by integrating the blocks back into the matrix that stores the multiplication
    - The last step is to deallocate the space used for the matrix zones
